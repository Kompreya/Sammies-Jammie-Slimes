## Sammie Jammie Slimes

Work in progress mod for Minecraft 1.12.2

Goal: To create a mod that allows the end user to define and configure transformative slimes through a json file.
Can create your own slime entities with custom IDs, names, and color or texture.
Can define what items you can use on the slimes which will transform them into other user defined slimes.
Can define whitelists or blacklists for which slimes each slime is or isn't allowed to transform into.

Mod was inspired by my wife who wanted a slime mod that allowed you to feed slimes different flavor jams and the slimes turn into different jam slimes based on the jam flavor fed to them.
